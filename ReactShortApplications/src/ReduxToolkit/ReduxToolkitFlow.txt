We have to create a redux store using configureStore().
Inside configureStore, we have multiple reducer store.

Connect this store with our react application using Provider of react-redux with a props of store.

Create a redux state slice using createSlice(basically in that we defined store name(name), default value(initialState), all the actions on store(inside reducers key), )
we have to export all the action so we used actions in other files

Now, we have to used get a data from store by using useSelector
and dispatch any action by using useDispatch
